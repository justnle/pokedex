# Pokedex

A Pokedex web application that displays a list of Pokemon in National Pokedex order, utilizing [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for data. The user can get more details of the Pokemon, 'capture' the Pokemon to localStorage, and view a list of all of the caught Pokemon. The list of caught Pokemon will display the Pokemon's nickname (if given one), captured date, and captured level. The captured date is generated by using `Date.now()` which is then converted to ISO 8601 `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD`, and the level is a randomly generated integer between one and one hundred. Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
